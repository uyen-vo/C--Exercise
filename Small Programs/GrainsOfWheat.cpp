/*Analyze the complexity of the chosen program in a way similar to how we
did in class (refer to the lecture slides #35â€“45 in the complexity.pdf file),
and write the complexity of each component as well as the total complexity
as line-by-line comments (as shown in the lecture slide #45) and print
out the whole file
